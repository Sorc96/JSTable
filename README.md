# JSTable

The JSTable is a lightweight, dependency-free JavaScript plugin which makes a HTML table interactive.

The plugin is similar to the [jQuery datatables](https://datatables.net/) but without the jQuery dependencies.

The implementation is inspired by [Vanilla-DataTables](https://github.com/Mobius1/Vanilla-DataTables). Unlike Vanilla-Datatables this implementation is using the in ES6 introduced [classes](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_classes.asp).  
Additionally JSTable includes the possibility for server side rendering, which is inspired by [jQuery datatables](https://datatables.net/manual/server-side).
